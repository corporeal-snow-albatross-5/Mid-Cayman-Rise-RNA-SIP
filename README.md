# Mid-Cayman-Rise-RNA-SIP
bioinformatics analysis of data generated from sequencing 1) metagenomes of unmanipulated diffuse deep-sea hydrothermal vent fluid 2) metatranscriptomes of these same fluids and 3) metatranscriptomes from RNA-SIP (with 13C-bicarb) incubations from these same fluids. This analysis will provide insight into the active microbial autotrophs.
